ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm Aakash, a **Computer Science Graduate from NYU**.

I have completed my Masters from **New York University** and BTech from **Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies**. I am a Data Scientist at TCG Digital working closely with clients to understand their business goals and translate them into data science solutions. I am also learning ML Ops at [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/). Plus, getting to know more about [Algorithmic trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzGZB4HhEE&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

I enjoy reading books, traveling to different places and experiencing new cultures.
