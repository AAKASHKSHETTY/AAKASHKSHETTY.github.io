ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm Aakash, a **Computer Science Graduate from NYU**.

I have completed my Masters from **New York University** and BTech at **Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies**. I am currently a Machine Learning Intern at AI4CE Lab working on mapping NYC for autonomous vehicles.

I am currently working on [ðŸ“¸SuperSlam](https://github.com/adityamwagh/SuperSLAM){:target="_blank"} a collaborative effort with a fellow NYU and CMU graduates. I am also learning to streamline model training, packaging, validation, deployment, and monitoring to run ML projects consistently from end-to-end.

Occasionally, I enjoy reading fiction books and trading equities. Learn [algorithmic trading](https://youtu.be/xfzGZB4HhEE?si=BGSL3jKev3ot74EN).
