ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm Aakash, a **Computer Science Graduate from NYU**.

I have completed my Masters from **New York University** and BTech at **Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies**. I am a Machine Learning Intern at AI4CE Lab working on mapping NYC for autonomous vehicles.

I am also working on [ðŸ“¸SuperSlam](https://github.com/adityamwagh/SuperSLAM){:target="_blank"} with fellow NYU and CMU graduates, learning end-to-end machine learning operations (MLOps) through [ðŸ“–Made With ML MLOps Course](https://madewithml.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

I enjoy reading fiction books, traveling to different places and experiencing new cultures.
